            <p>Go hard or go home<br>Get enough exercise and sleep: Sounds trivial, but it's not.
                You may have the urge to work 24/7, to skip the gym and to stay up late to get
                a few more things done. That's short-sighted. Exercise and sleep are critical
                to having the physical and mental energy necessary to meet a challenge.
